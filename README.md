# Crypto Wallet

A small project made for a private purpose. I was sick of logging into Binance every time to check the value of the wallet.
## Demo

## Features

- Fetch crypto exchange rate via Binance's webhook
- Calculate wallet balance for 4 different cryptocurrencies
- Drawing a graph using [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/)

## To do

- Redesign the site to match new features
